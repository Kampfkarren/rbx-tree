# Roblox XML Model Format, Version 4
This is unofficial documentation for Roblox's XML model format. The XML model format is used for places (`.rbxlx` files), models (`.rbxmx` files), Roblox Studio settings, and many objects uploaded to Roblox's asset storage.

The XML model format has generally been replaced by the newer, more efficient [binary model format](/binary). Some use cases for the XML format still exist, owing to its human readability.

This documentation is incomplete. Contributions are welcome.
